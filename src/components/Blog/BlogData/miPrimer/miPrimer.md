# **My First Post on This Blog!!**

# My Portfolio

After spending some time thinking about creating a **portfolio**, I finally managed to finish it — but only after going through more than 10 video tutorials, 20 articles, and lots of trial and error. It took time because there were many things I didn’t know how to do, so I had to learn a lot along the way.

## Blog

The idea of this blog is not to talk too much about myself. Instead, it’s more focused on **software development** — maybe sharing tutorials, breaking down how I built some of my projects, improving my writing, and eventually posting anecdotes or random stories.

The hardest part was simply deciding to start. Technically, it was also challenging because this wasn’t part of the original plan. There is no backend, no database, and no tools or templates like **Docusaurus** to make things easier. Everything is local.  
But it has one downside:  
What will happen when I have too many files? The project might become very heavy 🤔.

### **Implementation**

For writing posts, my first choice was **Markdown (.md)** because it allows clean content structure without needing _HTML_ or _CSS_.  
This makes writing much easier, but implementation becomes harder:  
finding the .md file dynamically for each post, reading its content, and then rendering it with styles and metadata (title, author, date…).

With the structure I have now, adding a new post is simple — just create a Markdown file and include some extra data like title, date, tags…

Something I still haven’t solved is loading **local images**. For now, I upload them to **Imgur**.  
Posts only load when they are opened, so even if the number of posts grows, the initial load time won’t be affected.

## Future…


Although honestly, I feel more excited to start new ideas — I’ve already learned a lot from this project.
